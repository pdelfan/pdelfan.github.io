Through a web design and development\n            course at SFU, I was introduced to SEEDA and tasked with creating a\n            new design for their website in order to increase online engagement.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Redefining the brand</h3>\n          <p>\n            At an initial meeting with SEEDA, I set out to gain an understanding\n            of the company’s mission, audience and personality. I narrowed down\n            potential customers to investors and engineering organizations that\n            seek expert advice.\n          </p>\n\n          <Img\n            fluid={data.seedaColors.childImageSharp.fluid}\n            alt=\"A colour palette was created for the style guide.\"\n            className=\"border\"\n          />\n          <figcaption>\n            A colour palette was created for the style guide.\n          </figcaption>\n\n          <p>\n            Having identified the target audience, I started working on a style\n            guide to summarize SEEDA’s values, ensuring a consistent, creating\n            guidelines for elements that play a role in the look and feel of the\n            website, to be used by designers and developers to ensure brand\n            cohesion.\n          </p>\n\n          <Img\n            fluid={data.seedaStyleGuide.childImageSharp.fluid}\n            alt=\"Style guide for SEEDA.

The elements that were designed in the\n            style guide were put together to form components such as headers and\n            forms. These components were then combined to form layouts of the\n            pages.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"background-seeda\">\n          <Img\n            fluid={data.seedaDevices.childImageSharp.fluid}\n            alt=\"Home page of the website.\"\n            className=\"wrap-large\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"wrap-small\">\n          <p>\n            The website was developed to be responsive and device-agnostic.
