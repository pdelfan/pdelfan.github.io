The elements that were designed in the\n            style guide were put together to form <b>components</b> such as\n            headers and forms.

This\n            allowed me to create components and layouts, minimizing the amount\n            of code. The framework also allowed me to use plugins for improving\n            peformance, such as automatically optimizing images, adding features\n            to convert the site to a{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/\">\n              {\" \"}\n              progressive web app\n            </a>\n            .
